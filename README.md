Stop wrestling with complex infrastructure and endless boilerplate. **Ecotone brings simplicity back to PHP development** by letting you focus on what matters: your business logic.

* **Write code that reads like your requirements**\
  "When a user registers, send a welcome email." That's not pseudocode—it's how you'll actually write it. Your code becomes self-documenting.
* **Start simple, scale when ready**\
  Begin with straightforward, synchronous code. Need async processing later? Add a single attribute. No architecture overhaul required.&#x20;
* **Resilience built-in**\
  Reliable Workflows, automatic retries, error handling, and self-healing capabilities come standard. Fewer production fires, more peaceful nights.
* **Framework agnostic**\
  You will never be forced to extend or implement any framework related classes. Ecotone seamless integrate with your application using declarative configuration using attributes. And this works beautifully with Symfony, Laravel, or any other framework using Ecotone Lite.&#x20;

### Your app, your way

Whether you're building a fresh startup idea or modernizing legacy code, Ecotone grows with you. From simple CRUD to event-sourced microservices, the same familiar patterns guide your way.&#x20;
