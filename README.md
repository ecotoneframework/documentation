Stop wrestling with infrastructure and boilerplate.\
&#xNAN;_**Ecotone** lets you focus on what matters: your business logi&#x63;**:**_

* **Write code that reads like your requirements**\
  "When a user registers, send a welcome email." That's not pseudocode—it's how you'll actually write it. Your code becomes self-documenting.
* **Start simple, scale when ready**\
  Begin with straightforward, synchronous code. Need async processing later? Add a single attribute. No architecture overhaul required.&#x20;
* **Resilience built-in**\
  Reliable Workflows, automatic retries, error handling, and self-healing capabilities come standard. Fewer production fires, more peaceful nights.
* **Framework freedom**\
  No base classes to extend. No interfaces to implement. Just attributes\
  on your own code. Works with **Symfony, Laravel, or standalone**.
* **Enterprise patterns, startup simplicity**\
  CQRS, Event Sourcing, Sagas, Projections — the architecture behind\
  scalable systems, now accessible without the complexity tax.
