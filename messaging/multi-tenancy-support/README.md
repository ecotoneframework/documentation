# Multi-Tenancy Support

Ecotone provides support for building Multi-Tenant based Systems. As Ecotone aims to focus on the business part of the system, not technical parts, the code we will write will be the same as in non Multi-Tenant systems.\
This way even if our System does not need Multi-Tenancy now, if we will consider it in future, it will work out of the box. And we can safely focus on the business part of the system.
