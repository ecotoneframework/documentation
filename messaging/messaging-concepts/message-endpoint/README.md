# Message Endpoints/Handlers

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/endpoint (1).jpg>)

Message Endpoints/Handlers are consumers and producers of messages. Consumer are not necessary asynchronous, as you may build synchronous flow, compound of multiple endpoints. \
You will not have to implement them directly, as you should not even have to build messages and invoke or receive message directly from the [Message channel](../message-channel.md). Instead you will be able to focus on your specific domain model with with an implementation based on plain PHP objects. By providing declarative configuration, you can "connect‚Äù your domain-specific code to the messaging infrastructure provided by _Ecotone_.&#x20;



All Message Handlers follows simple low level interface

```php
interface MessageHandler
{
    /**
     * Handles given message
     */
    public function handle(Message $message): void;
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`Command Handlers, Event Handlers, Query Handlers` are also Endpoints.
{% endhint %}
