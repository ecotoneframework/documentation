{% hint style="success" %}
An Ecotone is a transition area between Eco-Systems, where they meet and integrate.\
Ecotone Framework follows on that and provide abstraction, which allows us to join different Business functionality in seamless way.\
Each Business functionality can work as autonomous unit, where Ecotone respect it's boundary, yet allowing it to connect to the wider part of the System.

## Workshops

In order to get you and your team, up and running with Ecotone quickly and to build understanding around topics like **Resilient Message Driven Architecture**, **DDD**, **Event Sourcing,** you may schedule workshop with Ecotone's founder [**Dariusz Gafka**](https://medium.com/@dariuszgafka).

## Ecotone Basics - Workshop

This workshop is built around 3 topics, which will build shared understanding on how to use **Ecotone** to **refocus** the code base back on the **Business Domain Logic** using **Message-Driven architecture**.\
We will touch important topics like **Messaging, asynchronous processing, system resiliency and fault tolerance**. We will explore **DDD Aggregates** which we will connect to Message-Driven architecture and most importantly we will explore how to **test** it all together.

### The basic tutorial includes:

1. **Resilient Messaging** - What is Message-Driven architecture, how to use it for decoupling the system and how to make the application self-heal application and recover from errors.
2. **Building Blocks** - What are Aggregates, how can we use them to protect our business logic and how can they be connected to Messaging.&#x20;
3. **Testing** - Testing in Message-Driven architecture, Aggregates and asynchronous scenarios.
