"Ecotone is open-source licenced under MIT, which means you will be always able to use it free of charge. The sponsorship is therefore optional, yet I highly appreciate it. This is a way of saying thanks, for my personal investment of almost 7 years of continues work. Work which I put into building Resilient Messaging Patterns based on [EIP](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) and all the other features Ecotone provides, which are now available for the community."

## Workshops

In order to get you and your team, up and running with Ecotone quickly and to build understanding around topics like **Resilient Message Driven Architecture**, **DDD**, **Event Sourcing,** you may schedule workshop with Ecotone's founder [**Dariusz Gafka**](https://medium.com/@dariuszgafka).

## Ecotone Basics - Workshop

This workshop is built around 3 topics, which will build shared understanding on how to use **Ecotone** to **refocus** the code base back on the **Business Domain Logic** using **Message-Driven architecture**.\
We will touch important topics like **Messaging, asynchronous processing, system resiliency and fault tolerance**. We will explore **DDD Aggregates** which we will connect to Message-Driven architecture and most importantly we will explore how to **test** it all together.

### The basic tutorial includes:

1. **Resilient Messaging** - What is Message-Driven architecture, how to use it for decoupling the system and how to make the application self-heal application and recover from errors.
2. **Building Blocks** - What are Aggregates, how can we use them to protect our business logic and how can they be connected to Messaging.&#x20;
3. **Testing** - Testing in Message-Driven architecture, Aggregates and asynchronous scenarios.
